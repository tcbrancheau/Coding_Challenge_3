Introduction

This is a personal coding project to show using C# with Selenium.  This will be framed as a set of tests using the NUnit framework for a particular use case.  

Use Case tested

For this project, we will look at creating a shopping list on the Publix website.  Not the delivery site which uses Instacart, but the regular Publix website.

This shopping list will have milk, eggs, bread, and cheese.

Test Cases
Even though the use case is simple, we will go through three scenarios.  The first will be getting Publix branded items.  The second will be brand name items.  The last will be a mixture of Publix and brand name items.
